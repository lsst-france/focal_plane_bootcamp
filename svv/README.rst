Introduction
============

This is an example reStructuredText document that starts at the very top
with a title and a sub-title. There is one primary header, Introduction.
There is one example subheading below.
The document is just plain text so it is easily readable even before
being converted to HTML, man page, PDF or other formats.

Rubin technical notes

has many more powerful features that Markdown doesn't have. We aren't
taking advantage of those yet though.

- Bullet points
- Are intuitive
- And simple too
