# Directory where the output files of 'bps prepare' go. Ensure the parent
# directory exists and is writable by you. Since the pipetasks will execute
# in a batch job, avoid using file systems local to the compute node
# (e.g. /tmp) and prefer a file system visible from both the batch farm
# and the login farm.
